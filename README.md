* Distributed Machine Learning

In this repository you can find Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Apache Spark using the Python version (aka PySpark). Currently you can find:

- Anomaly detection: This implementation allows finding unsual data in datatset. The idea is provide data in a table-like format, where the row is a case and the column conatins the features. Data can be time series, or regular features used in classification/regresion
