# Distributed Machine Learning

In this repository you can find Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Apache Spark using the Python version (aka PySpark). Currently you can find:

- **Anomaly detection**: This implementation allows finding unsual data in a dataset. The idea is to provide data in a table-like format, where each row is a case and the column contains features. Data can be time series or regular features used in classification/regresion
